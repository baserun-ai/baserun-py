Honey Vanilla Ice Cream

Prep time: 5 min, + 2 hours minimum chill time
Cook time: 30 min + overnight chill time
Servings: 8-10

Ingredients
1 pint heavy cream
1 cup milk (whole milk recommended)
2 Tbsp vanilla extract
1/2 cup honey
1 cup sugar

Directions
Add milk and sugar to medium sized bowl and mix until dissolved.
Add heavy cream and vanilla extract and mix.
Stir in honey.
Chill in refrigerator for at least 2 hours.
Add to ice cream maker and let it go for 30 minutes.
Swiftly remove from ice cream maker (I use a silicone spatula as it allows for sides to be scraped down) and put into container.
Freeze ice cream overnight - a few hours will do in a pinch but overnight is better.
Scoop out of container and serve! Goes great with honey cake.
